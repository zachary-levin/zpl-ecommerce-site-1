  ## Description

  Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

  - What problem does it solve? It solves the problem of needing to understand fundamental architecture of what an e-commerce site looks like under the hood (back end).
  - What did I learn? I learned how to take an existing Express.js API and refactor it to utilize Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.
